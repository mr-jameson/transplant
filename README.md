## Purpose

### Mission Statement
TransPlant is the place to buy and sell indoor plants - because everybody should have more plants in their space.

#### The Problem
##### Carbon Emissions
Climate change is caused by humans generating excessive carbon dioxide emissions. Plants absorb carbon and emit oxygen. The world needs more plants. TransPlant encourages people to grow plants, sell them online for profit and help the planet at the same time.

Indoor plants are also shown to improve air quality in an environment, which has health benefits. 

##### Demand for Indoor Plants
Demand for indoor plants is on the rise and there is room in the market for more vendors. Indoor plants are in fashion in 2019. Many young people are enthusiastic to decorate their homes sustainably. They care about the environment and they want to create a greener future. 

The trend towards decorating city apartments and offices with indoor plants has been accelerated by social media. Instagram users post beautiful pictures of their stylish plants and influence others to take an interest in plants.

Plants have a calming effect on the mind. Decorating your home or office with green plants can improve the mental wellbeing of the occupants. 

##### Existing Marketplaces
Many Australians buy their indoor plants in store from Bunnings. This does not cater for those who wish to sell their plants. Plants are easy to grow and cultivate for those who are handy around the garden. The ability for users to sell plants is key to the functionality of TransPlant.

Some people sell their plants on large existing platforms such as Gumtree or Facebook; however, these are generic buy/sell platforms which do not directly target the niche of indoor plants. TransPlant aims to create a market hub specifically for indoor potted plants.

### User Stories
#### Target Audience
TransPlant is for anybody who wants to buy or sell potted indoor plants; either to make their home or office greener or to make some money by selling their excess plants. 

Much demand for indoor plants comes from inner city dwellers and offices,who don't have outdoor gardens.

### Functionality
#### Tech Stack
The tech stack employed in this Ruby on Rails application is as follows:
- Rails version 5.2.3 
- Ruby version 2.6.3
- Markup language: HTML
- Styling: CSS
- Database: PostgreSQL
- Authentication/Authorisation: Devise
- Cloud storage: s3
- Payment: Stripe
- Deployment: Heroku

#### Architecture
This Ruby on Rails application utilises Model View Controller (MVC) architecture. MVC architecture is a way of grouping code into three functionalities which allow web applications to be developed in parallel by multiple developers as well as enabling the code to be easily reused.

The Model layer interacts with the database. Any functionality such as creating, reading, updating or deleting data is carried out within the model. The view is the front-end of the application. It takes care of the elements that the user will see and interact with. The controller sits between the model and the view. It handles the HTTP requests and orchestrates view events and model changes accordingly. 


#### Features
- Search Bar
- Refine Results

#### Models
Object-relational mapping (ORM) is the link between a relational database management system and your preferred object-oriented programming language. ActiveRecord is an ORM framework used in Rails. It is used to represent models and the associations between these models.

#### Trello
Trello has been utilised to manage and track tasks within the project. 

The project is structured to achieve a minimum viable product (MVP) by the end of week 1. To contain the scope of the project, 'Nice to have' features are separated out to be implemented only after MVP has been met.

Tasks are further broken down into; planning, documentation, coding and styling. Planning and documentation are addressed first, followed by coding and then finally styling.
